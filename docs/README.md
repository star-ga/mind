# MIND Documentation

This directory collects deep technical documentation for the MIND language, compiler, and runtime. Each guide is designed to be published later at `mindlang.dev/docs/*` without changing the internal paths.

## Core Guides

- [CLI Reference](cli.md)
- [Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Type System](type-system.md)
- [Autodiff](autodiff.md)
- [IR & MLIR Integration](ir-mlir.md)
- [FFI & Runtime Embedding](ffi-runtime.md)
- [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md)
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

For historical design notes see [`design/`](design/) and [`rfcs/`](rfcs/). Reference material for the surface language lives in [`specs/`](specs/).
