# RFC 0000: [Title]

- **Start Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **RFC PR**: [#NNNN](https://github.com/cputer/mind/pull/NNNN)
- **Status**: Draft | In Review | Accepted | Rejected | Implemented

## Summary

One-paragraph explanation of the feature or change.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it were already implemented and you were teaching it to another MIND programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how MIND programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use MIND.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.

## Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. Examples:

- Does this feature exist in other languages and what experience have their communities had?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through implementation after the RFC is accepted?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect MIND as a whole. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
