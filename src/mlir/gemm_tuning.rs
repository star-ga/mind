//! Cache-blocking knobs for the fused Q16.16 GEMM macro-kernel.
//!
//! These constants drive the BLIS-style loop nest
//! `jc → ic → pc → jr → ir → microkernel` emitted by
//! `emit_vec_matmul_mm_q16` (single-thread) and `emit_mm_q16_row_band` (the
//! per-thread band kernel the multithreaded wrapper composes). They are the
//! ONLY thing an autotuner needs to sweep — the kernel logic is invariant to
//! the values; only locality (and therefore throughput) changes.
//!
//! ## Why blocking and why these numbers (Haswell: L1d 32 KiB, L2 256 KiB/core)
//!
//! Without K-blocking the inner reduction streams a `K`-deep B column panel for
//! every output tile, so the working set scales with `K`; at `K = 512` the
//! K×N B panel is 512 KiB and falls out of L2, collapsing throughput
//! (measured 4.5 → 2.56 GMAC/s, 64³ → 512³). Splitting the K reduction into
//! `KC`-deep panels and accumulating panel-partials in an i64 C-scratch tile
//! bounds the resident set independently of `K`.
//!
//! Bit-identity holds because each product is shifted `>> 16` to a fixed i64
//! BEFORE summing, and i64 add is associative + commutative: the panel-partial
//! sums add to exactly the full-K sum, truncated once at the end. Packing the
//! A/B panels into contiguous scratch is pure data movement, so it does not
//! perturb a single output byte either.
//!
//! Working-set budget at the chosen point (`MC=64, KC=256, NC=128`):
//!   * i64 C-scratch tile  `MC*NC*8 = 64 KiB`  → resides across the pc loop
//!   * packed B panel       `KC*NC*4 = 128 KiB` → reused across the ic loop
//!   * packed A panel       `MC*KC*4 = 64 KiB`  → reused across the jr loop
//! The packed B panel (128 KiB) is the largest reused tile and the A panel +
//! C-scratch (128 KiB together) fit alongside it inside the 256 KiB L2; the
//! `MR×NR` microkernel inputs stream from L1. Total per-call scratch is
//! `64 + 128 + 64 = 256 KiB`, allocated once per kernel invocation on the
//! stack (`llvm.alloca`, compile-time-constant extent — statically reserved,
//! no pointer bits leak into the artifact). In the multithreaded path each
//! worker is a distinct function activation, so its scratch is private by
//! construction (no shared accumulator, no data race).
//!
//! An autotuner may sweep `Q16_MC / Q16_KC / Q16_NC` freely; the emitter
//! handles every `M%MC / N%NC / K%KC / N%NR / M%MR` remainder. `Q16_MR` and
//! `Q16_NR` are the register-tile dimensions (4 rows × an 8-wide i64 column
//! vector) and are wired into the microkernel's accumulator shape; changing
//! them requires the matching accumulator-vector edits, so they are pinned.

/// Row block — rows of C (and of the packed A panel) held resident per `ic`
/// step. `MC * NC * 8` (the i64 C-scratch) and `MC * KC * 4` (packed A) must
/// fit L2 alongside the packed B panel.

// ── int8 "det.igemm" tier ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The fused int8 GEMM (`__mind_blas_matmul_mm_i8_v`) reuses the EXACT BLIS loop
// nest as the Q16 kernel, with two differences that do not change the working-set
// budget: (1) A/B source elements are 1-byte i8 (sign-extended once during the
// pack into the i32 packed panels — the panels stay i32, identical extent to the
// Q16 panels), and (2) the microkernel performs a pure integer multiply-add with
// NO `>> 16` shift (int8 is integer, not fixed-point). The C-scratch accumulates
// i64 and is truncated to i32 once at the store. Because the packed panels and
// C-scratch keep the Q16 element sizes (i32 / i64), the L2 budget reasoned about
// for Q16_MC/KC/NC holds unchanged, so the int8 tier reuses the same numbers.
//
// Byte-identity / overflow: each product is `(i32)a*(i32)b` with |a|,|b| ≤ 128,
// so |product| ≤ 16384 (well under 2^15). The running per-element sum is carried
// in i64 throughout (the C-scratch is i64), so the full-K reduction is exact for
// any K up to the i64 range; the single i64→i32 truncation at the store yields
// the exact int32 sum (it fits i32 for K ≤ ~2^31/2^14 ≈ 131072 with worst-case
// saturated inputs, far beyond realistic K). i64 add is associative + commutative
// ⇒ any tiling / lane order gives the identical int32 result, and the SAME MLIR
// lowers to `vpmaddwd` (x86 AVX2) or `SDOT`/`SMMLA` (aarch64) producing the same
// exact int32 sum — cross-substrate bit-identity by construction.

/// int8 tier row block. Held at the champion 64. The row axis is a double dead
/// end — MC=80 (iter 9) and MC=32 (iter 7) both regressed — and the speculative
/// MC=96 trial is reverted here: at MC=96 the i64 C-scratch is `MC*NC*8 =
/// 96*256*8 = 192 KiB`, which together with packed-B spills L2, the same
/// C-scratch-pressure failure mode the larger-MC moves keep hitting. The
/// residency budget is better spent on the COLUMN axis (see `I8_NC`), so MC
/// stays at the measured best. 64 = 16 * MR=4, a clean register-tile multiple.
/// Byte-identity is independent of the row tile: it only repartitions the outer
/// row loop and never reorders an integer product.

/// halves the packed-B footprint so it stays genuinely L2-resident instead of
/// L3-streamed, at the cost of 2× more pc K-panels (8 vs 4 at K=1024, more
/// C-scratch RMW). It is THIS halving that re-opens the column axis explored by
/// the current `I8_NC=384` experiment: at NC=384 packed-B is `KC*NC*4 =
/// 128*384*4 = 192 KiB` and packed-A is `MC*KC*4 = 64*128*4 = 32 KiB` — had KC
/// stayed at 256, packed-B alone would be 384 KiB and the wider column block

/// were BOTH set at the THEN-champion KC=256, where packed-B was `KC*NC*4 =

/// keep B resident. The KC=128 win HALVES packed-B: at NC=384 it is

///   4 K-steps per instruction over the same NR=8 i32 partials. VPDPBUSD is
